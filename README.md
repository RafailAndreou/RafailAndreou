# Welcome to my github
I am from Cyprus, Rafail Andreou, born in 2002. Currently, I am pursuing my passion for computer science at the University of Thessaly.

## About Me

Ever since I was a teen, I've been captivated by the world of computers. It didn't take long for me to realize that I wanted to dive deep into the realm of computer science. At the age of 14, I took my first steps into programming, starting with the fundamentals, primarily focusing on Python, HTML(Not a programming language btw) ,CSS, and JavaScript. As I honed my skills, I ventured into the realm of C++, fascinated by its power and versatility.

## Exploring Cybersecurity

While initially intrigued by the intricacies of cybersecurity, a brief foray into the field left me feeling like my true passion lay elsewhere within computer science. I discovered that what truly sparked my interest was the art of creating software, bringing ideas to life through code.

## GitHub: My Digital Archive

Unfortunately, most of the projects I worked on were lost to time. However, thanks to the wonders of GitHub, I've been able to preserve some of my early endeavors and track my growth as a programmer.

## Current Endeavors

Nowadays, you'll find me immersed in university life, delving deeper into the world of computer science and exploring new technologies. I've expanded my repertoire to include languages like Flutter and Java. With a knack for quick learning, I'm always eager to tackle new challenges and expand my skill set.

## Learning Journey

Throughout my university experience, I've had the opportunity to explore a wide range of topics, including machine learning, data science, signals and systems, databases, computer systems, and many more. Each new subject has provided me with valuable insights and enriched my understanding of computer science.

Feel free to explore my repositories and follow along with my journey as I continue to learn, grow, and create!
