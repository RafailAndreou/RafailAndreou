# Welcome to my github
I am from Cyprus, Rafail Andreou, born in 2002. Currently, I am pursuing my passion for computer science at the University of Thessaly.

## About Me

Ever since I was a teen, I've been captivated by the world of computers. It didn't take long for me to realize that I wanted to dive deep into the realm of computer science. At the age of 14, I took my first steps into programming, starting with the fundamentals, primarily focusing on Python, HTML(Not a programming language btw) ,CSS, and JavaScript. As I honed my skills, I ventured into the realm of C++, fascinated by its power and versatility. I genuinely love solving problems, and it's one of the reasons I started programming.

## Exploring Cybersecurity

While initially intrigued by the intricacies of cybersecurity, a brief foray into the field left me feeling like my true passion lay elsewhere within computer science. I discovered that what truly sparked my interest was the art of creating software, bringing ideas to life through code.

## GitHub: My Digital Archive

Unfortunately, most of the projects I worked on were lost to time. However, thanks to the wonders of GitHub, I've been able to preserve some of my early endeavors and track my growth as a programmer. Many of these lost projects were useful automation tools for games, reflecting my passion for creating software and my enjoyment in the process of building personal useful tools.

## Current Endeavors

Nowadays, you'll find me immersed in university life, delving deeper into the world of computer science and exploring new technologies. I've expanded my repertoire to include languages like Flutter and Java. With a knack for quick learning, I'm always eager to tackle new challenges and expand my skill set.

## Learning Journey

Throughout my university experience, I've had the opportunity to explore a wide range of topics, including machine learning, VLSI design, data science, signals and systems, databases, computer systems, and many more. Each new course has provided me with valuable insights and enriched my understanding of computer science.

Feel free to explore my repositories and follow along with my journey as I continue to learn, grow, and create!

## My Goal

My goal right now is to develop a robust alternative to FlutterFlow, designed to run locally for enhanced performance and privacy. This application will empower developers to create sophisticated, cross-platform mobile applications with ease, leveraging a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface. By open-sourcing this tool, I aim to foster a collaborative community where developers can contribute to and benefit from the platform, promoting innovation and shared learning in the app development space. Unfortunately at the moment my time is limited but when I find free time I will try to bring this idea to life. I am also open for collaborations.
